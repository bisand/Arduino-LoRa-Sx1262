# Arduino-LoRa-Sx1262
Long-Range Radio implementation for Arduino using LoRa Sx1262 900mhz radio.  Extremely lightweight and fast code that works on many Arduino platforms.

This library uses:
 - 2042 bytes of flash
 - 50 bytes of ram
 - <sup><sub>(Updated of v1.0, Aug 2023)</sub></sup>

## Compatibility

# How to use (Examples)
## Receive Example:
```C++
#include "LoraSx1262.h"

LoraSx1262* radio;
byte receiveBuff[255];

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Booted");

  radio = new LoraSx1262();
}

void loop() {
  //Receive a packet over radio
  int bytesRead = radio->lora_receive_async(receiveBuff, sizeof(receiveBuff));

  if (bytesRead > -1) {
    //Print the payload out over serial
    Serial.print("Received: ");
    Serial.write(receiveBuff,bytesRead);
    Serial.println(); //Add a newline after printing
  }
}
```

## Transmit Example
```C++
#include "LoraSx1262.h"

byte payload = "Hello world.  This a pretty long payload. We can transmit up to 255 bytes at once, which is pretty neat if you ask me";
LoraSx1262* radio;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Booted");

  radio = new LoraSx1262();
}

void loop() {
  Serial.print("Transmitting... ");
  radio->transmit(payload,strlen(payload));
  Serial.println("Done!");

  delay(1000);
}
```
